    "Automations": "(WIP) The automations page allows for the user to enable or disable the server from automating turning off or on the reactor, turbine, and the turbine inductor. Additionally, you can set the server to monitor either the efficiency or the speed of the turbine; these two options are mutually exclusive. In efficiency mode, the server will always set the maximum vapor input rate to twenty-five times the number of blades in the turbine. In speed mode the server will increment or decrement the maximum vapor input rate until the speed of the rotor reaches within plus or minus five of the target speed. The target speed can be can be incremented or decremented as the user desires, however it is recommened to set this value to either one thousand eight hundred or nine hundred. The power toggle button currently does not do anything; however, the increment-able maximum and minimum values is used by the inductor setting to automatically engage or disengage the inductor. The server can also monitor the reactor control rods, automatically inserting them when the reactor is in the power configuration mode. The temperature toggle will allow the reactor to react to the levels of the temperature and automatically insert the reactor control rods into the core if the reactor control rod toggle is also enabled. Lastly, the vapor toggle button currently does not do anything; however, much like the power toggle button, the maximum and minimum values is used by the reactor status setting to automatically turn off or on the reactor when those values are reached.",
    "Connection Info": "This page shows various connection info including this client's name, the server the client is connected to, the latency since the last message from the server, and lastly the timestamp of the most recent snapshot.",

    "Histograms": "The histograms page shows what the average values of varying turbine or reactor statistics are over a course of time. The statistics can be either turbine power, turbine vapor, turbine, coolant, reactor fuel, reactor power, reactor vapor, and reactor coolant. The selected histogram can be switched by pressing the arrows to the left and right of the title. Additionally, clicking on the upper limit of the x-axis will increment the x-axis by 1 minute up to the current maximum.",
    "Manage Clients": "This page displays a list of all clients that have logged into this server. The colors of the rows shows, at a glance, how old a connection is. Clicking on a row will remove the client from the list of authorized clients; this will force the client to have to reauthorize.",
    "Rod Statistics Info": "This page shows a list of all control rods found inside of the connected reactor and allows for manual control over the insertion level of the rods. If the insertion rods are automatically controlled then actions taken here will be overwritten by the automations."
