(WIP)
The automations page allows for the user to enable or disable the server from automating turning off or on the reactor, turbine, and the turbine inductor. Additionally, you can set the server to monitor either the efficiency or the speed of the turbine; these two options are mutually exclusive. In efficiency mode, the server will always set the maximum vapor input rate to twenty-five times the number of blades in the turbine. In speed mode the server will increment or decrement the maximum vapor input rate until the speed of the rotor reaches within plus or minus five of the target speed. The target speed can be can be incremented or decremented as the user desires, however it is recommened to set this value to either one thousand eight hundred or nine hundred. The power toggle button currently does not do anything; however, the increment-able maximum and minimum values is used by the inductor setting to automatically engage or disengage the inductor.
 
The server can also monitor the reactor control rods, automatically inserting them when the reactor is in the power configuration mode. The temperature toggle will allow the reactor to react to the levels of the temperature and automatically insert the reactor control rods into the core if the reactor control rod toggle is also enabled. Lastly, the vapor toggle button currently does not do anything; however, much like the power toggle button, the maximum and minimum values is used by the reactor status setting to automatically turn off or on the reactor when those values are reached.
