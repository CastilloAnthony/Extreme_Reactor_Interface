The histograms page shows what the average values of varying turbine or reactor statistics are over a course of time. The statistics can be either turbine power, turbine vapor, turbine, coolant, reactor fuel, reactor power, reactor vapor, and reactor coolant. The selected histogram can be switched by pressing the arrows to the left and right of the title. Additionally, clicking on the upper limit of the x-axis will increment the x-axis by 1 minute up to the current maximum.
